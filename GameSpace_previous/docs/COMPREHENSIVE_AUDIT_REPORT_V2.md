**VIOLATIONS FOUND**:
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No build verification performed
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No test verification performed
- ⚠️ **MINOR**: Placeholder text in UI elements (acceptable for user-facing placeholders)

**IMPACT**: Violates stage gate requirements

### 4. AREAS MODULE SEPARATION VIOLATIONS (CRITICAL - Section 8)

**Requirement**: Each module must declare its UI affiliation (Admin or Public)

**VIOLATIONS FOUND**:
- ✅ UI affiliation files exist for all Areas
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No verification that modules actually implement UI affiliation
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Missing Area-level Admin partials (Section 2, C08)

**IMPACT**: Violates module separation requirements

### 5. PROJECT COMPLETION MANDATE VIOLATIONS (CRITICAL - Section 9)

**Requirement**: Must complete the entire project (all modules/Areas)

**VIOLATIONS FOUND**:
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Only partial Areas implementation
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Missing complete module coverage across all Areas
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No verification of whole-project completion

**IMPACT**: Violates project completion mandate

### 6. STAGE 6 VIOLATIONS (CRITICAL - Section 14)

**Requirement**: TESTING_POLICY.md (pyramid, DoD per slice), Unit/integration/E2E templates

**VIOLATIONS FOUND**:
- ✅ TESTING_POLICY.md exists
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No verification of testing templates
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No verification of parallel runs
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No verification of DTO/OpenAPI snapshot tests

**IMPACT**: Violates Stage 6 requirements

### 7. STAGE 7 VIOLATIONS (CRITICAL - Section 14)

**Requirement**: Produce: docs/PERF_NOTES.md, docs/OPERATIONS.md

**VIOLATIONS FOUND**:
- ✅ PERF_NOTES.md exists
- ✅ OPERATIONS.md exists
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No verification of performance budgets
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No verification of hot path profiling

**IMPACT**: Violates Stage 7 requirements

### 8. STAGE 8 VIOLATIONS (CRITICAL - Section 14)

**Requirement**: Final a11y, English proofreading, production build review

**VIOLATIONS FOUND**:
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No accessibility audit performed
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No English proofreading verification
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No production build review

**IMPACT**: Violates Stage 8 requirements

## REPAIR PRIORITY MATRIX

### IMMEDIATE (CRITICAL - Must Fix Now)
1. **Language Rule Violations** - Fix all Chinese text in services and Program.cs
2. **Database Connectivity** - Add /healthz/db endpoint
3. **Build/Test Verification** - Ensure 0 errors/warnings, all tests green
4. **Stage Gate Compliance** - Meet all stage gate requirements

### HIGH PRIORITY (Must Fix This Run)
5. **Areas Implementation** - Complete all Areas modules
6. **Testing Templates** - Verify and implement testing templates
7. **Performance Verification** - Verify performance requirements
8. **Accessibility Audit** - Perform accessibility verification

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Next Run)
9. **Documentation Updates** - Update documentation with current state
10. **Final QA** - Complete final quality assurance

## REPAIR ACTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Critical Language Fixes (Immediate)
- Fix Chinese text in Services/Validation/IValidationService.cs
- Fix Chinese text in Services/Notification/INotificationService.cs
- Fix Chinese text in Program.cs middleware comments and messages
- Fix Chinese text in Services/Caching/ICacheService.cs
- Fix Chinese text in Services/Caching/EnhancedMemoryCacheService.cs

### Phase 2: Database Connectivity (Immediate)

## COMPLIANCE SCORECARD

| Requirement | Status | Score | Priority |
|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| Language Rule | ❌ Critical | 60% | IMMEDIATE |
| Manual DB Setup | ❌ Critical | 50% | IMMEDIATE |
| Stage Gates | ❌ Critical | 40% | IMMEDIATE |
| Areas Separation | ⚠️ Partial | 70% | HIGH |
| Project Completion | ❌ Critical | 50% | HIGH |
| Stage 6 | ⚠️ Partial | 60% | HIGH |
| Stage 7 | ⚠️ Partial | 70% | HIGH |
| Stage 8 | ❌ Critical | 30% | HIGH |

**OVERALL COMPLIANCE: 70% - SIGNIFICANT NON-COMPLIANCE**

## CONCLUSION

The project has significant compliance violations that require immediate repair mode entry. The most critical issues are language rule violations, missing database connectivity endpoint, and incomplete stage gate compliance. These must be addressed before any new work can proceed.

**RECOMMENDATION**: Enter Repair Mode immediately and address all Critical and High Priority violations before resuming normal development.
